## Overview

The solution is a static page in which only HTML and CSS were used for its creation, it is a page in which you can see a cooking recipe divided into: image in the upper part, short title and description of the recipe, preparation time, ingredients, procedure and nutritional table.

## My process

It was created by structuring the content using divs and the respective labels of each element such as h1, h2, h3, img, p and table, the recommended fonts and colors were used except for the border of the preparation time and it was done with the Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In general, I already knew almost everything necessary to perform the task, however there were some moments in which I needed to do a quick search to obtain the best possible result, such as centering the bullet points of the unordered lists so that they were centered vertically in list item since I didn't know how to do this, until I found how to handle it with "::marker" and "::before".

```css
ul li::marker {
    font-size:1rem;
    color: var(--Dark-Raspberry);
}
ul li::before {
    content: "\2022"; 
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%); 
    font-size: 20px; 
    line-height: 1;
}
```
